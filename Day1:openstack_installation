Pre-requisite:
	Hardware RAM: 8GB
	RHEL openstack Image: RHEL7OSP-13.0-20180628.2-x86_64.iso	;4.5GB
	Dependency image: rhel-7.5-server-updates-20180628.iso		;1.3GB
	Dependency Image: rhel-7-server-additional-20180628.iso		;804.4MB
	RHEL7.5 FOR BASE OS: rhel-server-7.5-x86_64-dvd.iso		;4.6GB

Step1:Installing RHEL7.5 as base os
	1. create bootable pd of RHEL-7.5
	2. created partion of 180GB un-allocated. And restart the pc
	3. Time zome. 
		-uncheck kdump
		-network onn
		-time zone: india
		-Installation type:server with GUI
		-Hard disk: configure manually > Done
			select standerd partition
			click to create automatically: Here it will auto create. Modify the size as 70GB to /root and 30GB to /home.
			Hence 80GB remain for future os.
		   -Accept changes.
		-Begin installation > root password...............REBOOT. un-plug pendrive
	4. select previous os [my case ubuntu] in grub menu.
	5. fire $sudo update-grub in terminal. then restart.
	6. Select rhel75 in grub menu======> Now you are into RedHat 7.5

......In Server with Gui some of software needed are already installed like firefox, net-tools. so no need to install.

Step2: Configuring yum in rhel75
	1. Create folder			#mkdir /dvd
	2. #mount /dev/cdrom /dvd 			;to mount dvd folder with rhel cd source
										Error: no medium found on /dev/sr0     [means its not getting the rhel cd source]
	3.insert pen drive and then 
		#lsblk							;give info about storage block
	4. #mount /dev/sdb /dvd				;/dev/sdb is for pendrive
							Warning: device write protected, read only====> means it mounted successfully.
	  You can see the content of pendrive in /dvd folder by 		#ls /dvd

	Now, copy the file of dvd from one particular folder.
	5. #mkdir /dvd
	6. #cp -rvf /dvd/* /dvd/							;r=recursive, f=forcefully, v=verbose
	then ckeck the copied content by     #ls /dvd1

	7. Now create .repo file.
		#vi /etc/yum.repos.d/dvd.repo
					[dvd]
					name=dvd
					baseurl=file:///dvd1
					gpgcheck=0					save it.
	8. Confirm the repo file
		#cat /etc/yum.repos.d/dvd.repo				;it will show the content of file.

		#ls /etc/yum.repos.d					;you will get one other file redhat.repo file auto generated by installer.
												;Delete the redhat.repo file    ;otherwise dvd.repo will not work.
												;bcz, by default yum will auto-pick redhat.repo file.
		#rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo

	9. #yum repolist				;to update repolist, it will show number of software available to install

	Now, you can install any software using yum:
	10. #yum list wget				;it will list the wget software;if available in yum repolist/ or any dependency related to wget.
	11. #yum install wget			;to instal wget			[BTW, for server with gui: wget already installed]



Step3: All the pre-requisite iso file from previous software by navigating with file explorer.
		And paste into /home folder of rhel75 os

	-Since, these three are .iso file of software. So, you need to extract it to particular folder.
	1. Create directory of all individually
	   #mkdir /iso_rhel7osp
	   #mkdir /iso_rhel75_server_update
	   #mkdir /iso_rhel7_server_additional

	2. mouth the iso file to respective directory
	  #mount /home/RHEL7OSP...... /iso_rhel7osp
	  #mount /home/rhel-7.5.....   /iso_rhel75....
	  #mount /home/rhel7......    /iso_rhel_server...

	  Now you can view the content of iso file  by #ls /iso_rhel7osp

	3. Copy the content of all three files to a folder to make installer.
		#mkdir /openstack_software
		#cp -rvf /iso_rhel7osp/*  /openstack_software
		........similar for other two mount point folder also.

		...........Now you can provide, this folder location to yum repo file.



Step4: Creating yum for openstack.
	1. vi /etc/yum.repos.d/dvd.repo    
		
		Add these code:		[openstack]
							name=openstack
							baseurl=file:///openstack_software
							gpgcheck=0							save it.
		#yum repolist			;it will show entry for openstack entry also. [622]

		-openstack maintains a installer database for yum.So, create database by:  its sqlite db

		#cd /openstack_software
		#createrepo -v .		[.] to create databse in current folder, v for verbose.

		createrepo is command:if it's not installed, install it.
		#yum install createrepo

		
Step5: install openstack
		-packstack: its installer for openstack

		#yum install openstack-packstack
					If error:No package openstack-packstack available.
		then,
		#yum clean all
		#yum repolist			;now it will show more no of software in openstack repo[5022], prevously [622]
								;this is bcz, yum internally create cache of software, that forbid to update the newer one.
								;so we need to clear the cache by #yum clean all.

		Now,
		1. #yum install openstack-packstack			;it will start instaling packstack

		if you are using rhel7 inside vm, you need to mount the /dvd permanently.
		#vi /etc/rc.d/rc.local
				........
				........
				mount /dev/cdrom /dvd       save and exit.
			it will automatically mount cdrom after system reboot.

Step6: Disabling NetworkManager [permanently]

		there are some issue with the networkmanager and openstack.
		So, if networkmanager is enabled, openstack might not work.

		Check status:
		1. #systemctl status NetworkManager				;by default its ACTIVE
		2. #systemctl stop NetworkManager
		3. #systemctl disable NetworkManager			;it will permanently disable, will be disable even after system reboot.
		
		4. #systemctl status NetworkManager

		Myth: if NetworkManager stop/disable, pc will not get ip.
		You can check it by:
		#ifconfig				;it works

		5.Check the hostname
			#hostname					;output=mypc
			#ping mypc				;it will ping

			if hostname not working/ not pinging to local/global, enter its ip to hosts file
			#vi /etc/hosts

			#cat /etc/hosts
			127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
			::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6

			192.168.225.65	mypc

		6. Check internet ping working /not?
			#ping goo.gl				;working

		Now, everthing will work.


	
Step7: Install openstack services with packstack:
		
		1. #packstack --gen-answer-file=a.txt		
				;a.txt is the config file generated by packstack having all details Y/N which service to install/not?
				;it contains all initial credentials of openstack.

			if any error occur about dependency, resolve it.
			Sometimes, python or python-setuptools related issue.
			#python -V
			#rpm -q python-setuptools
		
		2. #vi a.txt				;you can get here all details which service to install/not??
									;more service more RAM; at the same time essential service should not be avoided.
		
		3. gettiing started with openstack installation.
			

		......Make sure you have enough RAM available [atleast 6GB]....
			otherwise,it will fail.

		4.Check the RAM
			#free -m			;you might see some/more ram are occupied by cache
								;this is bcz of copy operation, it consumes ram as cache.
		  to free this RAM,either:
			-rebbot the system
			-clear RAM using command line
		
			#echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
			
			Now ypu can see, the cache memory get cleared; by command:
			#free -m

			#cd /openstack_software
			#packstack --answer-file=a.txt
			Welcome to the Packstack setup utility ===========and it begins=====>

	
		.....its time consuming process, depends on RAM space and speed [might take 20-30min]..........


Step8: Playing with openstack
		-After successful installation. open system_ip in browser.
		-it will show openstack login-page.

		-you can login with demo credential created by packstacker, mentioned in a.txt file.


										

Step9: Disabling SELinx in RHEL:
		1. #sestatus
		2. #setenforce 0
